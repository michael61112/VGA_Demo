LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell hs/newline_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) hs/count_reg[0]/PRE, hs/count_reg[10]/CLR, hs/count_reg[1]/CLR,
hs/count_reg[2]/CLR, hs/count_reg[3]/CLR, hs/count_reg[4]/CLR,
hs/count_reg[5]/CLR, hs/count_reg[6]/CLR, hs/count_reg[7]/CLR,
hs/count_reg[8]/CLR, hs/count_reg[9]/CLR, hs/newline_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell vs/count[10]_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) vs/count_reg[0]/PRE, vs/count_reg[10]/CLR, vs/count_reg[1]/CLR,
vs/count_reg[2]/CLR, vs/count_reg[3]/CLR, vs/count_reg[4]/CLR,
vs/count_reg[5]/CLR, vs/count_reg[6]/CLR, vs/count_reg[7]/CLR,
vs/count_reg[8]/CLR, vs/count_reg[9]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
